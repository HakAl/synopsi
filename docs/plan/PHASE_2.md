# Phase 2: NLP Worker Implementation (Python)

Here, you'll create the Python script responsible for fetching, processing, and summarizing the content.

## 2.1. Set Up Your Python Environment

- Use a virtual environment (`venv`) to manage your project's dependencies.
- Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn torch transformers requests beautifulsoup4 feedparser
```

## 2.2. Content Fetching

- Use the `feedparser` library to fetch articles from RSS feeds.
- For websites without RSS, use `requests` to get the HTML content and `BeautifulSoup4` to parse and extract the article text.

## 2.3. Text Processing and Summarization

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Use `Pandas` and `NumPy` for any initial data manipulation and cleaning of the scraped text.

2. **Baseline Model (Optional but Recommended)**  
   Use `Scikit-learn`'s `TfidfVectorizer` for keyword extraction. This can be a good baseline or a supplementary feature.

3. **Summarization Model**  
   - For your hardware, a lightweight, fine-tuned model is crucial. A good starting point is a distilled version of a larger model. The `t5-small` model, fine-tuned for summarization, is an excellent choice. [^8][^9]
   - You can use the Hugging Face `transformers` library to easily download and use this pre-trained model. [^9][^10]

## 2.4. Prototyping in Jupyter Notebook

Use a Jupyter Notebook to experiment with different fetching strategies, cleaning techniques, and to test the quality of the summarization model on sample articles.

## 2.5. Script for the Worker

Create a Python script that:

1. Fetches articles from your defined sources.
2. Cleans and preprocesses the text.
3. Uses the fine-tuned PyTorch model to generate summaries.
4. Sends the original article and its summary to the Spring Boot API's `POST /api/articles` endpoint.
